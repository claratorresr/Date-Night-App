# Date-Night-App

The Date Night python application collects the user mood from the catalog available that contains options such as happy, sad, flirty, scared and angry as an input to create a recommendation “combo”. It includes a movie, a recipe and a restaurant offering takeout in the Pittsburgh area and it lets the user draw multiple recommendations, save the combo for later use or future reference, and see the history of their previous combo. This application uses data from the Yelp website through Web scraping, IMDB API, as well as a csv file containing recipes from Food.com. Additionally we incorporated different python libraries utilized in class including pandas, numpy, requests, json, matplotlib, and BeautifulSoup in addition to os.path, and tkinter, the standard graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the application through graphical icons instead of text-based user interfaces.
